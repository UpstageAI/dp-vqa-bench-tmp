# Instructions for evaluation
1. The reference answers are the ground truth for the model answers.
2. The score for each item is 1 if the model answer is the same as the reference answer, and 0 otherwise.
3. The unit could be included in the answer(e.g., 100,000 or $100000, 10 or 10%), but if the number is correct, the score should be 1.
4. The final evaluation score should be in the list format. For example, if the model answers are correct for all the items, the score should be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
5. Do not provide additional explanation of the scores.
